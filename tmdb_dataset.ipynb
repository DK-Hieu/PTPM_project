       "   'content': 'The film adaptation of Wicked is based on the Broadway musical, which is a loose adaptation of the 1995 novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West by Gregory Maguire. Both Maguireâs novel and the musical are expansions of L. Frank Baumâs original The Wizard of Oz novel was published in 1900 and its film adaptation in 1939. The musical is one of the longest-running and financially successful Broadway musicals of all time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a screenplay by Winnie Holzman (writer of the book of the Wicked musical) and Dana Fox (Cruella) and directed by Jon M. Chu (Now You See Me 2, Crazy Rich Asians), Wicked begins around the time The Wizard of Oz ends. The Wicked Witch of the West has died and Glinda the Good Witch is breaking the news to Munchkinland. As the munchkins celebrate and burn a giant, Wicker Man-style witch in celebration of the witchâs death, Glinda is asked by one of the munchkins if she knew the witch.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat follows is nearly three hours of how a green-skinned, outcast girl named Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) whose emotions spark wondrous fits of unbelievable magic interacts with the spoiled, entitled, and pink-infatuated Galinda (Ariana Grande) as they enroll in a magic school known as Shiz University.\\r\\n\\r\\nVisually, Wicked is jaw-dropping and beautiful. All of the talking animals look extraordinary and every sequence with the flying monkeys is a visual highlight. Peter Dinklage voices a goat teacher named Dr. Dillamond and he has one of the most emotional arcs in the film. The bear nurse and dog doctor in the opening moments of the film look so good for what little amount of screen time they have.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven how many VFX teams are credited in the film, itâs no wonder the CGI looks intricately gorgeous. The three VFX teams with the most credits in Wicked include OPSIS (The Fall Guy, Rescue Rangers), Framestore (Gladiator II, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice), and ILM (Venom: The Last Dance, Alien: Romulus). Then thereâs various work from about a dozen different other VFX teams/houses, but the most intriguing one is one called FoyProAI.\\r\\n\\r\\nFoyProAI doesnât have an accessible official website, but some digging around on an executive producerâs LinkedIn page gives some background. Foy stands for Fountains of Youth and FoyProAI specializes in de-aging, up-aging, and beauty work in film. Theyâve worked on Smile 2, John Wooâs The Killer for Peacock, and 400 shots on Wicked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are moments of greatness in Wicked that mostly stem from the chemistry between Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande. Grandeâs comedic roots, specifically her time and experience on SNL, really come into play here. Grande is essentially the comedic relief as Galinda as her outgoing personality carries most sequences while Erivo has more of a straightforward performance that has more of a dry delivery.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the generic musical formula is infuriating. Story beats pause and go out of their way to cater to multiple songs at times and it logically hurts your brain. Yes, itâs a musical and yes people are going to sing. But when the main characters are trying to get away on a flying broom as guards are pounding at the door and they spend another ten minutes dancing, crying, and bellowing about their broken friendship it becomes a nuisance. Get on the damn broom and sing on the way to your destination. It doesnât seem that hard.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome sequences are thrown in solely because theyâll make a big song more appealing (the whole rotating library straight out of Inception thing) or side stories that donât go anywhere because two characters need to seem closer than they are (Elphaba and Fiyeroâs awkward ten-minute excursion into the forest to free a lion cub). These are both roundabout executions that take the long way to showcase that Fiyero thinks reading is dumb and that heâs actually in love with Elphaba over Galinda.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film adaptation seems like itâs quite faithful to its source material, but the Hollywood concept of transforming nasty and recognizable villains into sad, relatable characters that the audience roots for is a dumpster fire of a concept. Pure asshole villains can be fantastic too and often make protagonists more interesting if done right.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the musical fantasy film treats Elphaba like dirt for the first hour and a half. Everyone looks down on her because of the color of her skin. Then when she finally becomes friends with Galinda, she develops a soft spot for mistreated animals. Itâs the main reason she turns against The Wizard of Oz (Jeff Goldblum) apart from being one of the only characters who can read magic spells.\\r\\n\\r\\nWicked is Mean Girls at Hogwarts as everybody sucks and is superficial apart from a character that is supposed to be evil. Elphaba mostly accepts the role of wicked witch because her beliefs donât match anyone elseâs and sheâs unwilling to adapt to their ways solely to keep the peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nWicked features some unreal VFX and even touches on some incredible ideas from time to time, but the ideas that work seem to stem from capitalizing on a fantasy world that was established over a century ago. As a film, Wicked conjures song after song and drags on and on solely because itâs a bloated musical that wants you to die a rhythmic, sometimes undecipherable, high-pitched death.',\n",

       "   'content': '*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'ve been a Wicked fan since 2010. My expectations for this film were extremely high! And I was blown away by how Jon M. Chu was able to bring this story a new life. Everyone involved did an excellent job! The choice to sing live paid off! Not one note was out of tune! Bowen Yang & Bronwyn James were absolutely hilarious as Phannee & Shen Shen. Marissa Bode was fantastic as Nessarose. Can\\'t wait to see her story continue in Part 2. I hope they include \"Wicked Witch of the East\" in the Part 2 Soundtrack. Ethan Slater was great as Boq. I\\'m excited to see how he becomes the Tin Man in Part 2 because that\\'s not shown on stage. He transforms behind the cabinet but I hope we actually see it in Part 2. Michelle Yeoh was great in every scene as Madam Morrible. She was very Wicked! Jeff Goldblum was amazing as The Wizard! I loved the new version of The Grimmerie! The way it opened was very cool! Jonathan Bailey was incredibly charming as Fiyero! Dancing Through Life was very well choreographed and his singing was great! Loved the way he met Elphaba in this version. I\\'m very intrigued to see him become The Scarecrow in Part 2. Ariana Grande was absolutely phenomenal as Glinda! She embodied everything about Glinda! Loved her homages to past Glindas in Popular. Her voice was very Angelic. You can tell that she studied a lot for this role. Can\\'t wait to hear her \"I\\'m Not That Girl (Reprise)\". Cynthia Erivo stole the show as Elphaba Thropp. She poured her heart into this character! I\\'m so excited to hear \"No Good Deed\" in Part 2! She was incredible! As for the Cameos in One Short Day, Loved seeing Stephen Schwartz as The Guard & Winnie Holtzman as an Emerald City Resident. Love the expansion of the Wizomania show to include Kristin & Idina telling the story of The Grimmerie. Loved that Idina did her Elphie Battle Cry. It didn\\'t take away from Cynthia\\'s at the End. The Film was meant to happen in 2024. Had it come out in 2016 or 2019, I don\\'t think it would\\'ve been as well done as it was! I can\\'t wait to see Part 2 and how much of The Wizard of Oz they include. I hope we get to see Dorothy\\'s Face. 10/10 No Notes.',\n",

       "   'content': 'OK, so I\\'m going to be swimming against the tide a bit with this, but I didn\\'t love it. We start where the \"Wizard of Oz\" story finishes off, only without the catchy \"Ding Dong the Witch is...\". Instead we get an ensemble dance number that is energetically performed, colourful and expertly choreographed but instantly forgettable. Then we meet \"Galinda\" (Ariana Grande) who arrives in her pink bubble to confirm the news and enjoy the celebrations. Turns out, though, that she and the erstwhile \"Wicked Witch of the West\" were once friends and so back in time we go to the birth of a little green baby who may (or may not) have been conceived within the bounds of happily married wedlock. Scoot on many years more and we discover that said green person - \"Elphaba\" (Cynthia Erivo) is accompanying her wheelchair bound sister \"Nessarose\" (Marissa Bode) to the \"Ozian\" equivalent of \"Hogwarts\" where she encounters the snobbish \"Galinda\" and a fairly comprehensive degree of hostility. Luckily for her, the legendary sorceress \"Madame Morrible\" (Michelle Yeoh) spots some hidden talent in this young woman and soon she is sharing rooms with her new nemesis and finding herself the butt of school jokes. Then enter the mischievous prince \"Fiyero\" (Jonathan Bailey) who tends to treat everyone the same and who\\'s been kicked out of more schools that he can shake a sceptre at. He does, however, manage to create an environment in which everyone can get along and that\\'s when things begin to change for an \"Elphaba\" who is to be made likeable by her now pally roomie. When a letter arrives from the all-powerful Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) summoning her to the \"Emerald City\", then they set off hoping to find answers to all of their questions, only to find that nothing there is as it seems... I have to admit that JB has been a friend of mine for many years, so I ain\\'t going to be saying anything bad about the man who might just be the next \"007\", and both Erivo and Grande do well enough with the set piece musical numbers - especially the lively and cleverly written \"Populer/lar\", but the rest of this just struck me as \"Harry Potter\" goes to the musicals where it meets \"Mean Girls\". Goldblum makes his presence felt, but in the same slightly affected fashion that he aways does, and though the visual effects are all fantastic, somehow they are all just so much more sterile to watch than when you see them within the confines of a theatrical stage - where this works so much better, and without the need for the commercially exploitative part 1 and part 2 released months apart. To be fair, everyone looks like they are enjoying themselves, there\\'s a fun number from Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth and Bailey brings some much needed charm to the proceedings but I\\'d probably just prefer a director\\'s cut that offered us the whole story in one three hour chunk so we can get that mediocre \"Defying Gravity\" power ballad out of the way (repeatedly) in one fell swoop. It\\'s a very polished production, and maybe the hype has just got to me, but I can\\'t pretend I wasn\\'t disappointed by this. Wilted more than wicked, sorry.',\n",

       "   'content': 'Itâs quite a rare occurrence these days when a much-anticipated film actually lives up to all of its pre-release hype, but this screen adaptation of the hit Broadway musical truly does so in every regard. Director Jon M. Chu has brilliantly brought to life the back story behind the lives and relationship of the two witches from the original L. Frank Baum novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900) and its 1939 classic screen adaptation, as well as Gregory Maguireâs 1995 prequel novel, Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West. In this stunningly beautiful and delightful big-screen production, viewers learn how the supposedly evil Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) came to know the purportedly Glinda the Good (Ariana Grande-Butera), sorcery students and college roommates whose relationship initially went through a series of changes from unabashed contempt to solid friendship. However, as high-level political intrigue unfolds in their homeland of the magical land of Oz â efforts clandestinely spearheaded by the supposedly all-powerful Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) and university headmistress Mme. Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) â Elphaba and Glinda become unwittingly caught up in the high-stakes subterfuge playing out around them, a development that jeopardizes the future of their friendship and the stability of Oz itself. The filmmaker thus subtly but effectively presents audiences with a fable on the nature of good and evil, particularly in terms of what actually constitutes wickedness, especially when itâs skillfully veiled. The result is a thoughtful and thoroughly entertaining tale replete with stunning musical numbers, excellent choreography, ample humor, gorgeous cinematography, an inspired production design and superb performances by the four principals, all of whom are certain to be strong awards season candidates (quite a recommendation coming from someone who unapologetically makes no claim to being a fan of musicals). More than that, though, âWickedâ is an insightful treatise on the quest for power and learning how to make judicious use of it, both in personal dealings and in matters of wider consequence, a fitting cautionary tale for our times (or any time, for that matter). If I had any complaint here, it would be my concern that this is yet another example of a story thatâs been divided up into two installments, a growing trend that I donât believe will ultimately serve the movie industry well. According to the director, this was seen as a necessary step to do justice to the source material, given that it would have been nearly impossible to cram everything into one picture without doing major damage to the content. And, to give the filmmaker the benefit of the doubt, perhaps that will ultimately prove true with the release of part 2 in 2025 (but Iâll reserve judgment on that for the time being). In the meantime, though, this first part comes through as promised, and, in this day and age, thatâs a cinematic miracle in itself.',\n",

       "   'content': \"Very good! I enjoyed <em>'Wicked'</em>.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlways impressive when a long run time flashes by - no doubt a sign of a sturdy movie. 2hr 40mins is how long this one lasts, I thought I might have felt that whilst watching but, honestly, I didn't. Since sharing my reviews online I have appreciated musicals much more, to the point that when I learn a film is from this genre it barely registers.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have never seen the stage musical, in fact the only detail I knew for certain was that it was from the world of <em>'The Wizard of Oz'</em> - which, in turn, I only know from the 1939 and 2013 movies, as well as one or two other flicks. As such, I wasn't actually sure where they were heading with the Wicked Witch of the West - but I approve.\\r\\n\\r\\nCynthia Erivo impresses as the aforementioned. I have to say, mind, that Ariana Grande is the person onscreen that stood out most. She does an excellent job at making her character's self-centered quirks so convincing, while also producing a few amusing moments too. Jonathan Bailey and Peter Dinklage are good, while Jeff Goldblum certainly fits his role.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ending, whilst perfectly fine and pleasing, is possibly a bit rushed/abrupt, though that's to be expected given it's only part one. The same can be said for most films that are split into multiple productions, to be fair. I am intrigued to see where part two goes, bring on this time next year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe music is, as one would expect, also a positive. Granted I don't think I'll be adding any of the tracks to my playlist, but I still had a pleasant time hearing all the songs come and go - not one sticks out like a sore thumb, so that's good. Elsewhere, visually and plot-wise I have no real complaints.\",\n",

       "   'content': 'https://good.film/guide/haters-will-tell-you-wicked-sucks-heres-why-theyre-wrong\\r\\n\\r\\nBroadway hits rely on a suspension of disbelief. With the right ingredients, even the oddest of ideas can take flight on stageâ¦ but in the delicate translation to screen, they crash-land. Take Cats: something about that core premise of humans playing felines â which theatre audiences lapped up (sorry) for decades â just didnât work at the movies.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the outside, itâs easy to paint Wicked with the same brush. Isnât it all a bitâ¦ silly? Thereâs a blonde Godiva who floats in a bubble. A green woman who was raised by a bear (and whose father may or may not be a wizard). And when they meet at a Hogwarts-style university, we find out their professor, Dr. Dillamond, is a talking goat. These arenât exactly the trappings of a thoughtful, award-winning piece of drama. But peel back the colours of any GOOD fantasy and youâll usually find the allegories are rich and meaningful. With its themes of parental guilt, absent fatherhood, disability, discrimination and class supremacy, Wicked is no exception.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook, weâre not saying Wickedâs perfect. At 2 hours 40 minutes, itâs knocking HARD on the âtoo long, wrap it up!â door. And thereâs characters that either overdo it a bit (Governor Thropp) or arguably, donât add much at all (oh Pfannee, do you even go to this school?).\\r\\n\\r\\nBut thatâs a bit like complaining about a scratch on a speedboat. A sleek, wondrous craft that can whiz you somewhere thrilling, and change you along the way. We didnât have crazy high expectations â hey, the everyday moviegoer isnât a hardcore Broadway fan â but honestly? You donât need to be. Wicked is a movie for anyone. And maybe thatâs why it feels so GOOD.',\n",

       "   'content': 'Wicked by Jon M. Chu is an ambitious adaptation that largely delivers on its promise to bring the magic of the beloved musical to the big screen. Visually, the movie is stunning, with vibrant set pieces and a cinematic take on Oz that feels both familiar and fresh. Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba brings an emotional depth that truly captures the characterâs struggles, while Ariana Grandeâs Glinda adds a balance of charm and humor. Together, their performances anchor the film and make the storyâs core themes, friendship, identity, and societal perception, shine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe musical numbers are undeniably the movieâs highlight. Songs like \"Defying Gravity\" are powerful and beautifully staged, though I couldnât help but feel the choreography, while good, could have been taken a step further to truly elevate the experience. The pacing is a mixed bag, with the first act taking its time to set the stage, which may feel slow for some. That said, once the story finds its rhythm, it balances the emotional beats with grandeur fairly well, though the shifts in tone could have been smoothed out more.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, Wicked succeeds as a visually impressive and emotionally resonant adaptation, even if it stumbles in a few places. Itâs a solid film for fans of the musical and newcomers alike. While thereâs room for improvement, particularly in pacing and choreography, itâs hard to deny that the performances and visual storytelling make it a worthwhile watch.',\n",
